# Exploring Factors Influencing Happiness Scores
**Overview**

This project aims to explore the factors influencing happiness scores using the World Happiness Report dataset. The analysis involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and data visualization.

*Data Collection*

Dataset: World Happiness Report
Columns: Overall rank, Country or region, Score, GDP per capita, Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Perceptions of corruption
Source: Kaggle

*Data Preprocessing*

Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
Performed data cleaning and formatting.
Explored the distribution of variables and identified outliers.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*

Calculated summary statistics for numerical variables.
Visualized the distributions of numerical variables using histograms, box plots, or density plots.
Explored correlations between variables using scatter plots or correlation matrices.

*Hypothesis Testing*

Formulated hypotheses about the relationships between different variables.
Conducted hypothesis tests (e.g., t-tests or ANOVA) to test these hypotheses.
Interpreted the results and concluded the significance of the relationships.

*Regression Analysis*

Performed linear regression to model the relationship between the happiness score (dependent variable) and other factors (independent variables).
Evaluated the significance of the regression coefficients and assessed the overall fit of the model.

*Data Visualization*

Created visualizations to illustrate the relationships between happiness scores and other factors.
Used geographical maps to visualize happiness scores by country or region.
Generated interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly or Bokeh.
